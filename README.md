## The task

Build a single-purpose web application which allows visitors to look for Wikipedia entries.

The website should be able to specifically fulfill two user stories; it should be possible to:

- search for Wikipedia articles containing a particular keyword;
- search for a random Wikipedia entry, for kicks

## First thoughts

FreeCodeCamp is generous enough to already provide useful references for the technical implementation of the project. 

1. Wikipedia's [API documentation](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page);
2. [Url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random) required for the random search.

That being said, for the **first task** it is necessary to:

1. call the Wikipedia API with the rightful request;
2. populate a list with one item for each of said entries

For the **second**, it is just necessary to directly open a new page to the defined url.

The technical implementation seems to be rather straightforward. Certainly more straightforward than the *Local Weather App*. Therefore, more time and attention are paid to the design of the page itself.
